## 🔍 SQL Analysis Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Used `SELECT` statements to understand table structure
- Checked record counts and column distributions
- Identified missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Validation
- Filtered invalid or null values
- Ensured data consistency using `WHERE` conditions
- Validated relationships between tables

### 3️⃣ Data Analysis & Queries
The SQL script includes:
- **Filtering & Sorting:** `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- **Aggregations:** `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- **Grouping:** `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- **Joins:** `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- **Subqueries**
- **Window Functions (if applicable):** `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`

### 4️⃣ Business Insights Generation
